Movie recommendation and analysis using feature engineering is a process of using data and algorithms to analyze and recommend movies based on certain features.
Feature engineering is the process of creating, transforming, and selecting features that are relevant to a particular problem.
Feature engineering can help to identify patterns and relationships in data that can be used to make recommendations.
For example, analyzing a userâ€™s past movie ratings can help to identify similar movies that they may enjoy.
Feature engineering can also be used to analyze movie reviews to identify certain elements in a movie, such as the plot, characters, and genre.
This can help to recommend movies that a user may be more likely to enjoy.
Additionally, feature engineering can be used to analyze movies to identify trends and patterns in the data, which can be used to make predictions and provide insights.
